<h1>BATMAN</h1>
 
<p>
    Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist
    Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In
    the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and
    industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after
    witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself
    physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger,
    and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies
    Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy
    the Joker.

<h2> JOKER</h2>
<p>The Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bill
Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, and first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman on April 25, 1940.
Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design while
acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial
appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero
Batman.</p>
